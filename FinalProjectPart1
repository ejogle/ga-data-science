Using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, my proposed final project is to predict whether or not a client subscribed to a bank term deposit. This particular dataset (bank-additional-full.csv) contains basic demographic information, previous marketing efforts information, and general economic indicators for 41,188 observations from May 2008 to November 2010. Overall the predictive modeling effort is trying to determine the success rate of direct marketing--cold-calling prospects with a product offer. This project interests me as my current work involves predictive analytics to optimize response to direct mail offers for loans--consumer, mortgage, and business--to potential borrowers.
