    "Answer: Using graduate school admissions data for 400 applicants--each applicant's GRE score, undergraduate GPA, and a \"prestige\" ranking of the applicant's undergraduate alma mater--we will try to predict whether or not an applicant was admitted. After referring to the data dictionary for an overview of the dataset, construct histograms to display the frequency distribution of each predictor and scatterplots to ensure colinearity is not present. Scatterplots of each predictor against the outcome variable (admittance) can also be constructed to confirm the existence of a causal relationship as well as indicating the significance of each predictor. The dataset can then be split randomly into two equally sized subsets--training and validation sets--on which to fit the model. A simple logistic regression is then run: first on the training dataset and then on the validation dataset. "
